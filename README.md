JavaScript Phase-1 Final Project Documentation

The following is a single web page application that pulls data from the balldontlie API located at: https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction . 

The application runs as follows. 100 random NBA players from 1979 to today are fetched using a GET request. The players name is displayed on the page. The user has 5 guesses to determine the team of the listed player. IF it is a former player then the user is supposed to guess the team that player played on most of his career. If it is a current player then the user is supposed to guess the team that he is currently playing on. When the user submits a 6th incorrect guess the page reloads and a new player name is generated.

FEATURES I WOULD LIKE TO ADD IN THE FUTURE:
I make a score counter on the screen, and post a leaderboard. Wow (lol), I think I literally just developed a great idea while blogging.
Should fix the case sensitivity*.
I just want to add here that I named this finalproject2 because I screwed up the push to github of finalproject1. This is just a copy of the working code from my original app idea.
