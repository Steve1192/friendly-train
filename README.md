JavaScript Phase-1 Final Project Documentation

Directions for user:
Every time this page loads a NBA player from 1979 to today will be generated. Your NBA knowledge is seriously lacking and I know you don't know ball. For current players, you guess the team they're on. For Former players, guess the team they played on the longest. You get 5 guesses. If you submit a 6th incorrect guess the page will reload and a new player will be generated. Keep in mind, spelling counts and the first letter of the team city and team name must be capitalized-- YOU DON'T KNOW BALL !!!

FEATURES I WOULD LIKE TO ADD IN THE FUTURE:
I make a score counter on the screen, and post a leaderboard. Wow (lol), I think I literally just developed a great idea while blogging.
Should fix the case sensitivity*.
I just want to add here that I named this finalproject2 because I screwed up the push to github of finalproject1. This is just a copy of the working code from my original app idea.
