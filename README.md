JavaScript Phase-1 Final Project Documentation

The following is a single web page application that pulls data from the balldontlie API located at: https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction . 

The application runs as follows. 100 random NBA players from 1979 to today are fetched using a GET request. The players name is displayed on the page. The user has 5 guesses to determine the team of the listed player. If it is a former player then the user is supposed to guess the team that player played on most of his career. If it is a current player then the user is supposed to guess the team that he is currently playing on. After a correct guess the user will see the output message declaring the user the winner. However, on the 5th incorrect guess the correct answer will be played as an output message. When the user submits a 6th incorrect guess the page reloads and a new player name is generated.

FEATURES I WOULD LIKE TO ADD IN THE FUTURE:
Score counter on the screen, and post a leaderboard.
Fix the case sensitivity*.
