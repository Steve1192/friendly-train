          <p id = 'p'>Directions: Every time this page loads a NBA player from 1979 to today will be generated. 
          For current players, you guess the team they're on. For former players, guess the team they played on the longest.
          You get 5 guesses. If you submit a 6th incorrect guess the page will reload and a new player will be generated. 
          Keep in mind, spelling counts and the first letter of the team city and team name must be capitalized-- YOU DON'T KNOW BALL !!!</p>
